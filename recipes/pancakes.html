    <h1>Baked Pancakes</h1>
    <p>This Dutch Baby Pancake is a light, puffy baked pancake with crisp edges and a tender center, made effortlessly in the oven. A simple batter of flour, milk, eggs, sugar, and salt is poured into a hot, buttered dish and baked at 425°F (220°C) until golden and risen. The result is a beautifully airy pancake with a delicate texture, perfect for topping with fresh lemon juice and a dusting of confectioners' sugar for a sweet, tangy finish. Serve warm and enjoy this elegant yet easy breakfast, perfect on its own or with fresh fruit, syrup, or whipped cream.</p>
